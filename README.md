Quantum Computing - Algorithms, resources, and demonstrations. Having received gratuitous funding from the IonQ Research Credits Program
in partnership with Azure, a majority of the work here will be conducted through the Azure cloud. All users get access to free credits
on account creation that should be enough for an introduction to quantum computing.

IBM is also recommended as they have quite a nice interface for performing the same experimentation. At the time of writing, access to IBM
quantum computers comes free of charge.

## Instructions
Read through the Azure Quantum Documentation to set-up your environment for access to quantum.

You may choose to execute in Azure, Python, or Jupyter notebooks. The Azure CLI is a personal favorite.

## An Introduction to Quantum Mechanics & Computing
Time permitting, this will be filled in.
